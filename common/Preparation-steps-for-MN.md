# Preparation steps to run a Deviant Masternode<br />
Such guide cover the following points:<br />
1. Configuration of Coin Control
2. Creation of Masternode address
3. Creation of Masternode collateral<br />

## Configuration of Coin Control<br />
The Coin Control feature allow the user to select the input that must be used to withdraw DEV during sending transactions. Without Coin Control you can't select the sending input, so you may corrupt the setup of input stakes, or destroy an unlocked Masternode collateral, for example.
Send men첫, without Coin Control looks like the below picture

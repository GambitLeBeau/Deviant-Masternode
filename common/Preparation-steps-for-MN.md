# Preparation steps to run a Deviant Masternode<br />
Such guide cover the following points:<br />
1. Enable Coin Control
2. Masternode address
3. Masternode private key
4. Masternode collateral<br />

## Enable Coin Control<br />
The Coin Control feature allow the user to select the input that must be used to withdraw DEV during sending transactions. Without Coin Control you can't select the sending input, so you may corrupt the setup of input stakes, or destroy an unlocked Masternode collateral, for example.
Send menù, without Coin Control looks like the below picture

<br />
The option to enable Coin Control feature is in the Gui Wallet:<br />
Settings -> Options -> Wallet<br />

Settings Options | Wallet tab
---------------- | ----------
![GUI-options](/images/GUI-options.png) | ![flagCoinControl](/images/flagCoinControl.png)

<br />
In the wallet tab, just flag "Enable Coin Control" to enable such feature.
Once enabled, the Send menù will looks like:<br />
<br />
<p><img src="/images/boxCoinControl.png" alt="CoinControl" /></p>
<br />
Just click on Coin Control, will open a new menù
<br />
<p><img src="/images/intoCoinControl.png" /></p>
<br />
In such menù you're free to select the sending inputs, leaving untouched collaterals and staking ones.

## Masternode address
Open the receiving address menù from your wallet<br />
